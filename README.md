# Maternal Health Monitoring System

This project focuses on the development of a machine learning model for early detection of preeclampsia, a pregnancy complication characterized by high blood pressure. Using physiological data captured via biosensors, the system analyzes vital signs to provide accurate maternal health risk assessments.

## Key Features

- **Early Detection of Preeclampsia:** Uses classification algorithms to identify early warning signs from physiological signals.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Implements algorithms such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Decision Tree for risk prediction.
- **Data Processing and Visualization:** Utilizes Python libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and scikit-learn for preprocessing, analysis, and visualization.
- **User-Centric Analysis:** Designed to assist healthcare professionals in proactive decision-making.

## Technologies Used

- Python (Jupyter Notebook) for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation
- Machine Learning libraries: scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib
- Serial communication data parsing (data collected externally)

## How It Works

1. Physiological data from biosensors is collected and transmitted to the PC.
2. The Python environment preprocesses the raw data, performing cleaning and feature extraction.
3. Machine learning models classify the data to predict the likelihood of preeclampsia.
4. The output provides a risk score to support early intervention and monitoring.
